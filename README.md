# PAA – Algorithm Design and Analysis

This repository contains solutions to the problem sets from the **Algorithm Design and Analysis** course. While the code focuses on exercise resolutions, it reflects a deep understanding of the fundamental principles behind efficient algorithm development and evaluation.

## What I Learned:

Throughout the course, I studied and applied the core concepts of algorithm design and analysis, including:

- **Time and space complexity analysis** (O, Θ, Ω)
- **Asymptotic behavior** and performance comparison between algorithms
- **Divide and conquer**, **greedy algorithms**, and **dynamic programming**
- Recurrence relations and the Master Theorem
- **Sorting algorithms** (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort) and their optimizations
- Graph algorithms: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal’s and Prim’s
- Problem-solving strategies and algorithmic thinking

## Tools & Languages:
- C++ (primarily for the exercise solutions)
- Python
- Java

## Key Takeaway:

This course strengthened my ability to analyze computational problems rigorously and design optimal solutions, balancing performance and correctness. It also sharpened my critical thinking when choosing or implementing algorithms based on complexity and problem constraints.

Even though this repository contains mainly exercise solutions, it represents a strong foundation in algorithmic theory and practice, crucial for software development, systems design, and competitive programming.
